Animating a sprite from a sprite sheet in Godot involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide:

### 1. **Prepare Your Sprite Sheet**
   - **Ensure your sprite sheet is properly formatted**: 
     - Each frame should be of equal size.
     - Frames should be aligned in rows and columns without spacing or padding (unless accounted for).
   - **Import the sprite sheet** into your Godot project.

### 2. **Create a New Scene**
   - **Open Godot** and create a new scene.
   - **Add a `2D Node`** as the root node of your scene (e.g., `Node2D` or `KinematicBody2D`).
   - **Add a `Sprite` node** as a child of the root node.

### 3. **Configure the Sprite Node**
   - **Assign the sprite sheet texture** to the `Sprite` node:
     - Click on the `Sprite` node.
     - In the `Inspector` panel, locate the `Texture` property.
     - Load your sprite sheet texture into the `Texture` property.

### 4. **Create an AnimationFrames Resource**
   - **Change the `Sprite` nodeâ€™s `Texture` property to a `SpriteFrames` resource**:
     - In the `Inspector`, find the `Frames` property (this appears after you change the node type to `AnimatedSprite`).
     - Click on the down arrow next to `Frames` and select `New SpriteFrames`.
   - **Edit the `SpriteFrames` resource**:
     - Click on the `Frames` property to open the `SpriteFrames` editor.
     - In the editor, click on the `Add Frames from a Sprite Sheet` button (a grid icon).

### 5. **Define the Animation Frames**
   - **Configure the grid for your sprite sheet**:
     - In the `SpriteFrames` editor, click on the `Grid` tab.
     - Set the `Hframes` and `Vframes` values to match the number of horizontal and vertical frames in your sprite sheet.
   - **Select the frames for the animation**:
     - Use the mouse to drag and select the frames you want to include in your animation.

### 6. **Create and Name the Animation**
   - **Create a new animation**:
     - In the `SpriteFrames` editor, click on the `New Animation` button.
   - **Name the animation**:
     - Give your animation a name, like "walk", "jump", etc.

### 7. **Set Frame Duration and Play the Animation**
   - **Set the duration for each frame**:
     - Select the animation you created.
     - Adjust the `Speed (FPS)` to control how fast the animation plays.
   - **Preview the animation**:
     - Click the `Play` button to preview the animation.
   
### 8. **Script the Animation (Optional)**
   - **Add a script to the parent node** to control the animation:
     - Attach a script to the root node (e.g., `Node2D`).
   - **Play the animation using GDScript**:
     ```gdscript
     func _ready():
         $AnimatedSprite.play("walk") # Plays the "walk" animation
     ```

### 9. **Save and Test the Scene**
   - **Save your scene** with a meaningful name.
   - **Test the animation** by running the scene.

### 10. **Adjust and Refine**
   - **Adjust the animation** speed, frame selection, and other settings as needed.
   - **Add more animations** to the same `SpriteFrames` resource for different actions like "jump", "idle", etc.

By following these steps, you can animate a sprite using a sprite sheet in Godot, bringing your characters and objects to life in your game.
